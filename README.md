# Physics Collision Simulation

This project is a physics-based collision simulation built with Unity. It demonstrates the behavior of a small box colliding with a larger, heavier box, following the principles of momentum and energy conservation.

## Features
- **Mass Selection**: Choose different mass values for the heavy box.
- **Accurate Collision Counting**: Detects and counts the total number of collisions.
- **Real-time Physics Simulation**: Uses Unity's physics engine for precise interactions.
- **Replay Functionality**: Restart the simulation to test different mass values.

## How to Play
1. Select the mass of the heavy box from the dropdown menu.
2. Start the simulation and observe the collision count.
3. Once the simulation completes, press the replay button to try again.
